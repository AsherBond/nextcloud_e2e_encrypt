# End-to-End Encryption App

This app provides all the necessary APIs to implement end-to-end encryption
on the client side. Additionally it makes sure that end-to-end encrypted
files are not accessible with the web interface and other WebDAV clients.

Here you can find the [API documentation](https://github.com/nextcloud/end_to_end_encryption/blob/master/doc/api.md).

## Limitation

- E2EE is currently not compatible to be used together with server-side encryption
